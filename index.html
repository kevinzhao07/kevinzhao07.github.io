            During my 10-week internship with Meijer this summer, I was able to familiarize myself with new
            technologies, help Meijer automate many agile workflow tasks, and gain valuable industry experience. I
            learned about the benefits of
            developing with agile and its stark contrasts with our previous waterfall methodology. Working with the
            Microsoft Coretek Team, we created and tested a program that would drive future development. Using Azure
            Cloud Services and its command line interface, I was able to add a powershell script into Meijer's existing
            development workflow to automate menial deployment-time tasks. Some of these tasks include checking if unit
            tests and
            postman tests pass, adding and notifying QA/developers to code reviews, moving task cards on our Azure
            Board, and much more. These now automated tasks took up about 40% of Meijer's development workflow, so our new 
            process enhancement intends to keep developers at their keyboards instead of worrying about fixing these smaller issues.

            created through a partnership between the University of Michigan Injury Prevention Center and Michigan
            High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA). SOS provides near real-time mapping of non-fatal and fatal
            overdose cases as well as aggregate data briefs to facilitate timely public health and public safety
            responses.

            ArtsEngine focuses on bringing together students from various academic backgrounds, and is aimed at
            combining specifically Engineering and
            the Arts. The website boasts dozens of grants and examples of previous projects to encourage students to
            start projects and research they otherwise
            would not be able to. ArtsEngine also offer assistance from professors and other mentors with the similar
            interests, promoting cross-learning from
            various communities.

              The old website hosting ArtsEngine was a mess-- pages were overflowing with small hard to read text, and
              media was virtually non existent. My team and I worked
              on several outdated University sites, giving them each a redesign using the Divi Theme Builder through
              Wordpress. We were able to write short and concise
              javascript, bringing some life into these already static pages. We also designed many modern themes and
              found a balance between media and text. The sites
              are expected to be lauched in late August, so stay tuned!

            This site hosts a magintude of popular search algorithms, from Djikstra, A*, Greedy, and most importantly,
            DFS and BFS. You can either create your own maze by placing walls
            in obscure places, or use a random maze that you can choose to be as sparse or dense as you'd like. The
            starting and ending nodes are adjustable as well, so you're able to place them
            next to each other or as far away as possible. While the algorithm is in action, there is a nice animation
            that displays the currently searched cells as it makes its way to the end node.
            Speed of the algorithm and animations are ajudstable, of course. After the animation has run its course, the
            shortest* path will be drawn (only applicable on certain algorithms!). At this
            point, the user is free the move either node and draw extra walls, which dynamicaly updates the shortest*
            path and searched cells accordingly. To visualize again, press "Visualize!" or start over
            by clearing the board.

              This is a React application that takes advantage of dynamically updating elements within the HTML. The
              entire grid is a table element whose cells can display walls, searched cells, paths, or stay empty.
              The main obstacle was dynamically updating the path and searched cells while the user moves the nodes, as
              the algorithms and updating of table cells must be implemented efficiently so this feature would work
              smoothly without too much lag.
              Another challenge was creating a queue in JavaScript without constantly updating the array size as moving
              every element would be too time consuming. This project taught me a lot about creating React applications
              and the many
              benefits of learning React. It also taught me to use async/await functions, as native JavaScript only
              offers a proper sleep/pause command that can only be implemented through asynchronous functions.

            Wolverine-DM is my take on combining my school spirit and appreciation of Minecraft's design with a
            blogging/messaging platform available to
            everyone. Users can register through the landing page, where they can then access posts and messages.
            Rudimentary features are all present:
            liking, editing, and deleting posts, commenting and replying to others, and updating profile usernames and
            photos. It also
            supports advanced features such as resetting account password through email and saving uploaded photos to
            Amazon Web Services.

              This platform utlizes Django and its rendering template to display QuerySets of posts, messages, etc. Most

            CLAWS, or Compact Localized Augmented Work Station, is the name of our team that is currently working on
            developing augmented reality prototypes for astronauts during extravehicular activities. Right now, visual
            aides for astronauts are massively underperforming their duties, and can result in astronauts facing
            difficult situations. For our Hololens prototype, we prioritized monitoring health statistics (heartbeat
            rate, pressure, oxygen levels, etc.) with a self-explanatory graphic user interface, so astronauts can work
            and take notes and pictures outside the vehicle safely.

              The Hololens portion is currently still in development. The website is a simple dashboard that allows
              anyone involved in the mission to create notes, add images, and update mission tasks that will then be
              sent as JSON data to the Hololens. The Hololens can also communicate with the website vice-versa. The site
              makes use of Django and its databases to store saved information. </p>

            College Bites was created by two college students, Kevin (me) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fion-lin08/" target="_blank">Fion Lin</a>, who both have a passion for cooking and trying new recipes. 
            Fion and I are college students soon to be graduating from the campus dining halls. In our new apartments, our biggest concern is cooking our own meals. During quarantine, Fion and I picked up some recipes and wanted to keep note of the new found knowledge! This is when we came up with College Bites.
            With the upcoming school year being pretty much remote and with all of our friends living off campus for the first time, we wanted to have a place to share a few recipes with our friends! It is also a great place of all of us to connect and give each other a small insight into our our food journey off campus.  
            The app is also keyboard accessible, creating an user friendly environment for everyone.

              Many complicated programming concepts are ignored because it's hard understand them well and use them in
              every day programming. I realized that I'm a person who would forget something unless I used it often.
              By writing these short and detailed explanations of common concepts and libraries, I can be reminded of
              core programming ideas without using them in every day production. There are tutorials on polymorphism,
              heaps and trees, setting up bootstrap, using javascript libraries, and so on. It's also a great resource
              for my brother, who is also studying Computer Science and is relatively new to many of these concepts.
              Writing these tutorials taught me to be a better technical writer by forcing me to be concise with my
              words. Check all them out in the <a href="https://github.com/kevinzhao07/tutorials-documentations"
